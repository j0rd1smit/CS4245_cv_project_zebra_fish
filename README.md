## Reproducibility
- The dataset has been made publicly available and can be found [here](https://github.com/j0rd1smit/CS4245_cv_project_zebra_fish/tree/master/dataset).
- The source code publicly available in this repo.
- The training process can be replicated using this [notebook](https://github.com/j0rd1smit/CS4245_cv_project_zebra_fish/blob/master/notebooks/colab/Detectron2_zebra_fish_segmatation-colab.ipynb) which can easily be run in [collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/j0rd1smit/CS4245_cv_project_zebra_fish/blob/master/notebooks/colab/Detectron2_zebra_fish_segmatation-colab.ipynb).
- The model weights for the final [standard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Djmf8dTG9Do21ij2w0ft3rPNBVuwEK7N/view?usp=sharing) and [fish type](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bfV5zsNltYMp0fG3IzJtHjAlMVI1BDYU/view?usp=sharing) model can be found our google drive.
